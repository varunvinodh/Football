# FIFA 19 Data Analysis

Football is one of my favorite sports, and growing up, FIFA was a game I played extensively. Inspired by my passion for both football and data analysis, I decided to explore the FIFA 19 dataset. This project analyzes player statistics from the 2018-2019 season to uncover insights about player performance, team dynamics, and attribute correlations. By merging my love for the game with data analysis, I aim to reveal interesting patterns and trends within the dataset.

## Data Description

The dataset includes a variety of attributes for each player, such as:

- **Basic Information**: Name, Age, Nationality, Club, Position, etc.
- **Performance Metrics**: Overall rating, Potential, Value, Wage, etc.
- **Skill Attributes**: Crossing, Finishing, Dribbling, etc.
- **Physical Attributes**: Height, Weight, Acceleration, Strength, etc.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Exploration**:
  - Understand the structure and quality of the dataset.
  - Handle missing values based on the nature of the data.

- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Perform statistical summaries and visualizations.
  - Analyze correlations between various attributes.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Create new features for deeper insights (e.g., Growth, Value in millions).

- **Club Analysis**:
  - Extract data for specific clubs (e.g., Chelsea FC).
  - Assemble the best squad based on player ratings.

- **Formation Simulation**:
  - Create football formations based on top players' positions and ratings.
  - Allow users to select different formations and generate the best squad.

- **Skill Analysis**:
  - Identify top skills required for different positions based on average performance metrics.
